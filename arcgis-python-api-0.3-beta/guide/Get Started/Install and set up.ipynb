    "The ArcGIS Python API is distributed via conda. Conda is a popular package and environment manager application that helps you install and update packages such as the ArcGIS Python API and their dependencies. To learn more about conda, see the [getting started guide](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html) for conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Conda\n",
    "Install the latest version of [Anaconda for Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (for Python 3.5), if you don't already have conda. The ArcGIS Python API requires Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed ArcGIS Pro 1.3, you already have conda and you can use that instead of downloading Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install arcgis package\n",
    "Download and install ArcGIS Python API in your conda environment, using the following command in your teminal. If you are running a Windows OS, you can type this into your command prompt or PowerShell or if you have installed ArcGIS Pro, then into your 'Python Command Prompt' shortcut within the ArcGIS Pro program group in Windows start menu. If you are running a Mac or Linux OS, you can type this into your terminal application.\n",
